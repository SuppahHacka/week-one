**Introduction to Digital History** 
* Github took some getting used to in terms of syntax 
  * But, the preview feature is very useful to visualize what you're doing!
  * It just takes a while to preview, seems to have some poor optimization. 
  
**Why I took the course**

As a little preface, I took this class simply because I am a nerd!
In all seriousness, tech is a passion I have always had and even if the history aspect may not be my favorite, 
I think the blend in both cultures would make for an interesting class. 
Ok... honestly i am dislking github... How long does it take to preview a text file? 

Moving on...

**Setting up the other required tools**
  * Both hypothes.is and zotero are very straightforward. 
    * I have always wanted to use a program like zotero so now I have an excuse! 
    *hypothes.is seems to have a lack of proper browser support, but seems to work fine on chrome (most of the time)

   * Honestly, I had a hard time following with exactly what needed to be done but I assumed the week one 
     deliverables are just to get familiar with the tools we will be using for the majority of the class. 
      *That being said, I will pay more attention in the future to what the podcasts (which sound great) instruct. 
        *I like to skip ahead of the instructions and figure things myself but I guess this is uncharted territory 
        for me. **Procceed with caution** 
        
**AND THAT'S THAT!**

...i hope this notes/reflection hybrid is satisfactory as a deliverable. We can definitely talk about it!
